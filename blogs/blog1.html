                  Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 was a scheduled
                  domestic flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport in
                  Lahore to Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, Pakistan.
                  On 22 May 2020, the Airbus A320 crashed into Model Colony, a
                  densely populated residential area of Karachi only a few
                  kilometres from the runway, while on a second approach after a
                  failed landing attempt with landing gear not extended. Due to
                  pilot error, the aircraft was badly damaged in the first belly
                  landing, with both engines flaming out during the go-around.
                  Of the 91 passengers and 8 crew on board the aircraft, 97 were
                  killed, and two passengers survived with injuries. Eight
                  people on the ground were also injured in the accident, one of
                  whom later succumbed to her injuries.

              The flight, piloted by Captain Sajjad Gul and First officer Usman
              Azam, took off from Lahore at 13:05 and was near the end of its
              90-minute journey, when it crashed at around 14:45 (09:45 UTC)
              into the densely-populated neighborhood of Model Colony around 3
              kilometres (2 miles) from the airport. The aircraft's wings were
              reported as being on fire moments before the plane crashed into
              the rooftops of the houses and buildings in the area, some of
              which caught fire. The crash was captured on video by a CCTV
              camera of a nearby building, which shows the aircraft just before
              crashing into the neighborhood.

              The aircraft initially made an aborted landing attempt, apparently
              with the landing gear not extended. One of the pilots subsequently
              radioed air traffic control (ATC) reporting landing gear issues
              and the failure of both engines. ATC confirmed to the pilot that
              he was cleared to use either of the airport's two runways,
              requesting, "Confirm your attempt on belly?" According to PIA's
              CEO, Arshad Malik, a technical fault prompted the aircraft to make
              a go-around rather than land, even though both runways were
              available. One of the pilots told the controller, "we are
              returning back, sir, we have lost engines." Twelve seconds later,
              one of the pilots declared a mayday emergency, which was the final
              communication with the aircraft.

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem">
              According to officials from Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority
              (CAA), complications had arisen during the aircraft's first
              descent. The landing gear was still in the retracted position when
              the aircraft attempted its first landing. Friction marks on the
              runway suggested there had been some ground contact; at the
              runway's 1,400-metre (4,500 ft) mark, the plane's left engine is
              believed to have scraped the runway; at the 1,700-metre (5,500 ft)
              mark, the right engine made contact. When the pilot went around,
              it is believed damage had already been caused to both engines from
              this contact, leading to engine failure after the go-around. This
              made it impossible for the aircraft to maintain altitude, causing
              it to crash during its return to the airfield. This is supported
              by the conversation between the aircraft and air traffic control
              which indicates that the aircraft was constantly losing altitude.
              Observers noted that the plane's ram air turbine was deployed,
              which supplies power to the aircraft's control systems when both
              engines have failed and without the auxiliary power unit (APU)
              running.

              The narrow streets and alleys comprising the area impeded the
              rescue services. ISPR, the Pakistani military's media wing,
              reported that special forces of the Pakistan Army and Pakistan
              Rangers had set up a cordon. Video footage of the crash scene
              showed emergency teams trying to reach the scene amid the rubble,
              clouds of black smoke and flames in the background.
